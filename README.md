My Personal Money Tracker
===

Hi! These are the macros I use to automate methods inside my personal money tracker
(separate from the money tracker itself, which is in Google Sheets).

I used the SOLID principles, as well as the design patterns I have learned from **CS 150: Programming Languages**, to make this code easy to add onto, and easy to study/review.
To make this possible, I use TypeScript (instead of JavaScript) to be able to utilize many of the theoretical concepts taught in the course.

I also tried my best to document this repository as thoroughly as possible, as well as make it as readable as possible.
Feel free to stroll around!

The reuseable duplicateable Google Sheets file is still under construction!
Thank you for your patience <3

Future Plans
===

In the future, I intend to:
- Use Model-View-Controller to segregate logic and input-output;
- Use message passing to minimize interactions between the model and view (this will be useful in the next item)
- Create a mobile-accessible view to be able to create logs through a separate interface
